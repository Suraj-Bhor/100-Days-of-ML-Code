# 100-Days-of-ML-Code
100 Days of ML Code is a commitment to better my understanding of Machine Learning by dedicating at least 1 hour of my time everyday to studying and/or coding machine learning for 100 days.

## Day 1: 9<sup>th</sup> April 2020 : Deep Neural Networks
* Watched all videos of week 4 of [Neural Networks and Deep Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome) by Andrew Ng. 
* Learnt about the forward and backward propagation along with its vectorized implementations for deep neural nets.
* Learnt about the hyperparameter tuning for complex neural nets.

## Day 2: 10<sup>th</sup> April 2020 : Implementation of deep neural net
* Completed the two programming exercises of [Neural Networks and Deep Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome).
* Implemented a 2-layer and 4-layer fully connected feed forward neural network for classifying cats vs non-cats images.
* Learnt about the vectorized implementation of entire neural net model.
* Earned a [certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/ZS8W2LCVSHM5) for completing the course.
