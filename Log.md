## Day 3: 9<sup>th</sup> July 2018, Monday
### Today's Progress:
* Was facing trouble in understanding vectorized implementations using numpy arrays, so referred to various blogs and videos and rewrote few functions to their fully vectorized form.

## Day 4: 10<sup>th</sup> July 2018, Tuesday
### Today's Progress:
* Went through the theory of Logistic Regression for two class classification problem and learnt things regarding:
    * Logit function and Logistic Regression Model
    * Hypothesis Representation
    * Linear and Non-Linear decision boundaries
